## **Getting Started**
### **For Users**  
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](#) page.  
2. Flash the OS onto your device using the included installer.  
3. Reboot your device and follow the onboarding process.  

### **For Developers**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyntharaOS/Synthara.git
2. Install build dependencies (see Build Guide).
3. Compile the kernel and deploy to supported hardware or virtual machine.
4. Contribute by creating new AI models or optimizing system components.

## **How It Works**
AI Kernel: Manages system resources, user interactions, and parallel task execution efficiently.
Task Manager: Instead of apps, tasks are directly assigned to the OS, e.g., “Prepare a presentation” or “Check emails.”
Gaming Engine: Supports direct integration of AAA mobile and PC games for native play.

## **Roadmap**
